    <h2>Rectangle: Definition and Properties</h2>
    <p>A rectangle is a geometric shape characterized by four right angles and opposite sides that are equal in length. It includes squares as a special case where all sides are of equal length.</p>
    <h2>Calculations for a Rectangle</h2>
    <p>To calculate various properties of a rectangle:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Side Lengths:</strong> The length and width of a rectangle can be determined by measuring any pair of opposite sides.</li>
        <li><strong>Area:</strong> The area of a rectangle is found by multiplying its length by its width. Mathematically, it can be expressed as: <span>A = l * w</span>, where <span>l</span> represents the length and <span>w</span> represents the width.</li>
        <li><strong>Perimeter:</strong> The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of the lengths of all four sides. It can be calculated as: <span>P = 2(l + w)</span>, where <span>l</span> represents the length and <span>w</span> represents the width.</li>
        <li><strong>Diagonals:</strong> A rectangle has two diagonals that bisect each other at their midpoint. The length of the diagonals can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: <span>d = âˆš(l<sup>2</sup> + w<sup>2</sup>)</span>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Fun Fact about Rectangles</h2>
    <p>Rectangles are widely used in various fields, including architecture, engineering, and graphic design. They offer simplicity in calculations and are often utilized in creating structured and organized layouts.</p>
